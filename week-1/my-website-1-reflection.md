1. [My Blog Repository](https://github.com/RedZulu/RedZulu.github.io)

2. Explain how to create a repository on Github and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
  - Click on the plus button in the top right corner of your github homepage, then add repository. Once you have filled out the initial setup in correspondance with what you want then you should see a repository page. On said page there will be a box in the lower right hand corner labled SSH clone URL. Copy the code within to your clipbord. Navagate to the folder you would like to store your clone through the command line. From there enter git clone then the url you coppied. You should see the repository clone file within the designated file selected earlier.

3. Describe what open source means.
  - Open source in development context refers to a software or hardware available to everyone and anyone. The schematics or code are open for anyone to modify and release if they so desire.

4. What do you think of Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  - If you're talking Utopia by Sir Thomas More in a satirical sense then yes. Open source has many benefits including the possibly of quick and exponential advancement in technology as well as the deconstruction of massive tech monetization. However, open source can only stay open source if open source is enforced. If this is the case than that leaves many people vulnerable to cyber attacks. Security would have to take an entirely new form. One that I can't comprehend. Thusly open source in my opinion could only exist in select areas such as education or other public domains. No it doesn't make me nervous.

5. Assess the importance of licenses.
  - Licenses protect the developers and the users. Not only does it allow select approved company to utilize serious code, such as bank wire transfer services, but it also assures the user that the product has been scrutinized and tested thoroughly for public safety.

6. What concepts were solidified in this challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  - Commiting and adding files to a directory were solidified for me. I was still having trouble pushing to github however. I can't seem to figure out which directory I need to push from and when. Though this time it didn't take me nearly as long. Two or three different tries and I was good to go. I ended up pushing directly to my master however.

7. Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand the topic? If so, please list it.
  - Sorry I didn't use anything else.
