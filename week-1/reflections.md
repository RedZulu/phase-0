# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
1. A shell acts as a user interface to the command line of an operating system. There are many different shells, Bash being one of them. Bash is currently the most popular shell and the default for Unix.

2. The most challenging aspect of this section for me was piping and redirecting. I think this gave me the most trouble because it came in conjunction with the usage of cat streaming over just using less or more. Iâ€™m not 100 percent certain what the difference between more and cat is specifically.

3. Yes I was able to use all of the commands. Though my .txt files were .rtf for some reason. I was using textEditor.

4. In my opinion the most important commands are ls, cd, and man/help

5.
  -pwd (print working directory)
  -ls (list directory)
  -mv (move file/rename file)
  -cd (move to directory, change directory)
  -../ (move back one root)
  -touch (make an empty file)
  -mkdir (make a directory)
  -less (display file contents)
  -rmdir (remove directory)
  -rm (remove file)
  -help (display all shell commands)
