      What are the benifits of version control?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Version control allows the developer to keep track of experimental changes to his/her final, master, code. Keeping new versions separate from your main line of code is good practice to maintain a healthier less buggy code. Once debugged and tested thoroughly the developer knows the new version is safe, and ready to be added into the master. Having this control also gives the user the ability to see all versions of his code in an organized compiled view. Reading through your code becomes almost like a book with chapters and annotations if your versions are maintained properly. This book can easily be handed off to other developers to edit and make suggestions.

      How does git help you keeps track of changes?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Git creates local versions of files with a short description, which you add via committing in the command line. Committing is like saving a version. You save a commit through the use of git. Git is basically a filing system for your code stored on your computer.

      Why use Github to store your code?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Github is a great sharing tool for coders. It acts as an online library for version control. You can upload your local git to Github and from there others can see your code. This makes group development project a breeze. All versions can be seen and edited by those who have permission respectively, remotely.
