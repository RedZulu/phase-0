// Reflection
/*
-What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
  We learned all about the for in loop and how it goes through each key in
  the object. Most importantly, we learned that the name needs to be different
  for the key when you're nesting multiple for in's.

-Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
  Object.defineProperty() might work really well but I'm not sure if it can reach
  nested data.

-What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
  This challange was really tough, but objects became a bit clearer for me.
