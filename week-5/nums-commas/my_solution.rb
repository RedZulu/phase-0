# Numbers to Commas Solo Challenge

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.

# 0. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?


# 1. Initial Solution
#def seperate_comma(num)
 #  group = num.to_s
  # comm = group.length - 3
   #while comm > 0
   #group.insert(comm, ",")
   #comm -= 3
  #end
  #print group
#end

# 2. Refactored Solution




# 3. Reflection
=begin
	
What was your process for breaking the problem down? What different approaches did you consider?

Was your pseudocode effective in helping you build a successful initial solution?

What Ruby method(s) did you use when refactoring your solution? What difficulties did you have implementing it/them? Did it/they significantly change the way your code works? If so, how?

How did you initially iterate through the data structure?

Do you feel your refactored solution is more readable than your initial solution? Why?
