How do you define a local variable?
A local variable is defined within its own function block.

How do you define a method?
You have to define a variable using the def function followed by the name of the method and then within parenthesis the parameters of said method.

What is the difference between a local variable and a method?
A method can receive inputs from a user, variables, or methods outside of itself to fill its parameters. A local variable can only be defined as one variable.

How do you run a ruby program from the command line?
type in irb or ruby your_program.rb

How do you run an RSpec file from the command line?
type rspec your_tester_program.rb

What was confusing about this material? What made sense?
I think the address problem has a bug in it the rspec for it wasn't working for me properly. I kept receiving a name identifier error.
