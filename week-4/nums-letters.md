###What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a number without a decimal. A float is a number with decimals. Use floats for more percision work. Use integer for faster computations.

###What difference between float and integer division? How would tou explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Float division takes the computer longer to process due to the amount of numbers used in the equation. Integer division is faster because it uses only rounded numbers, which takes up less memory.

```ruby
print 365 *24
print ((365 *24) * 10) * 60
```
