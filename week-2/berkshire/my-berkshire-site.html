<!-- Reflection goes here 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	It was very interesting making my words come to life in a sense. 
	
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	At first I had no idea that I needed to plug in HTML5 until testing the site out. 
	It was then I realized there was a problem. After doing the appropriate research I 
	found HTML5 to be a much more efficient language.
	
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	We wrapped our tags appropriately, kept our symbols lowercase, and had our lists
	organized appropriately. 
	
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	I like the simplicity of HTML, but I think that the sectioning system could use a 
	rework.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	I usually just imagine how the US decides on its abbreviations for states.
